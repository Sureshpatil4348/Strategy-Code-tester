        "# RSI Divergence Pairs Trading Strategy - MT5 Backtest (Automated for High Correlation Pairs)\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook implements an automated mean-reversion pairs trading strategy based on Negative correlation signals for all high correlation pairs. It connects to the MetaTrader 5 terminal to fetch data and performs a bar-by-bar backtest from 2020 to the present.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Strategy Overview & Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "- MT5 Terminal connection.\n",
        "- RSI (14-period) for entry signals.\n",
        "- ATR (5-period) based hedge ratio for lot sizing.\n",
        "- **USD-based profit targets** with risk management ($300 profit target, $150 stop loss).\n",
        "- Simple position sizing with ATR-based hedge ratios.\n",
        "- Maximum trade duration limit (24 hours).\n",
        "- 5-minute timeframe analysis from 2020 onwards.\n",
        "- Automated backtesting of a predefined list of negatively correlated pairs.\n",
        "- Individual CSV reports for each pair's trade history.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strategy Logic:**\n",
        "- **Entry Signal**: \n",
        "    - **Short both pairs** when both RSIs are > 70 (overbought).\n",
        "    - **Long both pairs** when both RSIs are < 30 (oversold).\n",
        "- **Exit Signals**: \n",
        "    - **Profit Target**: Combined USD P&L reaches **$300**.\n",
        "    - **Stop Loss**: Combined USD P&L drops to **-$150**.\n",
        "    - **Time Limit**: Trade duration exceeds **24 hours**.\n",
        "- **Lot Sizing (Enhanced)**:\n",
        "    - The first pair in the tuple is the \"base\" pair and is traded with a fixed lot size of **1.0**.\n",
        "    - The second pair's lot size is calculated using a robust ATR-based ratio that normalizes for volatility in pip terms.\n",
        "    - **Pip-Normalized Calculation**: `ATR_Symbol_Pips = ATR_Symbol_Raw / Pip_Size_Symbol`\n",
        "    - **Hedge Ratio**: `Lot_Size_2 = Lot_Size_1 * (ATR_Symbol1_Pips / ATR_Symbol2_Pips)`\n",
        "    - **Safety Bounds**: Lot sizes are capped between 0.01 and 10.0 lots, with extreme ratios limited to 5:1.\n",
        "    - **Universal Support**: Handles Forex majors/minors, JPY pairs, and precious metals (XAUUSD, XAGUSD) with correct pip sizing.\n",
        "    - **Broker Compliance**: Lot sizes are automatically adjusted to meet broker minimum/maximum and step requirements.\n"
