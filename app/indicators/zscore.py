Z-Score Indicator - Matches MT4 Logic Exactly

This module implements Z-score calculation that replicates the MT4 strategy
logic exactly as defined in Gold Buy Dip.mq4 lines 234-265.

MT4 Logic:
- Current price: Close[0]
- Historical prices: Close[1] to Close[period]
- Mean = sum(historical prices) / period
- StdDev = sqrt(sum((price - mean)^2) / period)
- Z-score = (current_price - mean) / stdDev
